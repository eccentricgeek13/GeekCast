<h2> The Joe Rogan Experience</h2>

<div>
    <p style="float: left;"><img src="Joe rogan .jpg" width=100px/></p>
    <p>Creator: Joe Rogan</p>
    <p>This is hands down the best interview show that has ever existed, and for a number of reasons.

        The first is that it's not edited, the talks go on as long as they take, and everyone is given an honest exchange without editing to make a point.
        
        But, it goes further than just that, Joe Rogan will sit down and talk to anyone, and I mean ANYONE, including media pariahs and people that will clearly speak four feet above his head. It doesn't matter who they are, he's sitting down and talking to them.
        
        And the thing is that he gets into the conversations, after three or four hours it's not uncommon to see him beg guests to stay just a little while longer because he's gotten into the conversation and that just draws you in further.
        
        You get to hear a range of topics, politics, science, arts and entertainment, conspiracy theories, sports, martial arts, comedy, literally anything and everything that can be debated and discussed eventually makes it's way onto the show, so much so that, when you tune in, you never know who the next guest is going to be and discussed as the conversations meander and spin their way through the show at the whims of interests.
        
        It's not the best in any category, but it's the only show with absolutely every category.
        
        This redefines the term variety show
